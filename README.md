These are the scripts I wrote to browse the files on a archive without going to the Internet Archive.

Uses curl, awk, grep, sed, printf, and echo like once for some reason. Might change that might not who knows.

Also you can use aria2 to download.

EDIT: Echo is used two times my bad.

Also feel free to take this trash and make it better or write it in a actual languege. (That is if you will be able to read it, lol!)
